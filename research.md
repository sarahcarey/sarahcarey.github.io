Sarah’s dissertation work uses transcriptomic and genomic data to address the evolution of sex chromosomes, differences in gene expression, and patterns of molecular evolution and genetic variation in bryophytes. This work largely focuses on the moss _Ceratodon purpureus_, whose genome is being sequenced by the Joint Genome Institute [(see section on Ceratodon purpureus genome project)](https://mcdaniellab.biology.ufl.edu/research/).<br/><br/>

A fundamental question Sarah’s research addresses is **how does 1 genome make 2 different individuals: males and females**. Two such ways are by putting genes on sex chromosomes or by differential use of autosomes.<br/><br/>

## Sex chromosomes in bryophytes

Mosses are haploid dominant and around 60% of the roughly 12,000 species have separate sexes. The sex chromosomes underlying the separate sexes are also haploid and are called UV sex chromosomes, where the U correlates with females and the V with males. The U and V sex chromosomes only meet in the monomorphic, non-sexed, diploid stage (called a sporophyte) after fertilization and segregate into males and females after meiosis. 

_Ceratodon purpureus_ has UV sex chromosomes which make up ~1/3 of the 360 megabase genome. Using data from the _Ceratodon purpureus_ genome project, where we sequenced a male and female isolate of _C. purpureus_, we are working to address the key differences between Ceratodon U & V sex chromosomes. Additionally, we are using a phylotranscriptomic approach to address when sex chromosomes evolved in mosses.<br/><br/> 

## Sex-biased gene expression

Using transcriptomic data from 6 isolates at 2 life-cycle stages (juvenile and mature-stage) of _C. purpureus_ we are working to address differences in gene expression on the autosomes between the sexes.<br/><br/>  

## Genetic and structural variation

Using resequencing data from 23 isolates from _C. purpureus’_ wide geographic range and PacBio data from our genome isolates we are addressing what are the patterns of genetic and structural variation within this species, particularly between the sex chromosomes and autosomes.<br/><br/>
